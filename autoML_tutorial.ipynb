    "## <a name = why></a>I. Why do we use AutoML?\n",
    "In such an era of information explosion, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence play an important role in many industries such as Healthcare, transpotation, financial service etc. Data Science experts are highly involved in tranditional Machine Learning applications to help with feature engineering, model selecting and parameter tuning. To reduce the tedious workload for human experts and lower the barrier to entry, AutoML has emerged as a solution. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from feature engineering to a deployable machine learning model <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Automated_machine_learning\"> (source: Wikiwand)</a>. Therefore, it not only helps data scientist to reduce time of building models and to better focus on interpreting results to clients but also makes machine learning techniques accessible for people not knowing a lot about data science. There are several autoML packages available:\n",
    "1. [TPOT](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)\n",
    "2. [H2O](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)\n",
    "3. [auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/)\n",
    "4. [Microsoft autoML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-automated-ml)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, We will focus on introducing AutoML technique by using TPOT, and leveraging the tool to a classification probrlem on [telecom dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to predict customer churn rate. The goal of this post is to introduce AutoML method to tyro in data science"

    "TPOT is a Automated Machine Learning tool in Python that assists data scientist to search an optimize machine learning algorithm pipelines using genetic programming, which intelligently implement Grid Search on all possible piplelines and find the best fit. TPOT is and open source tool and have a detailed [documentation](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)\n",

    "It is time concuming for data scientist to go through the process from data cleansing to parameter optimization as well as model validation. TPOT can relieve workload and provide an intuition to data scientist. Besides, one of the advantages of TPOT is it will try all possible algorithms and may explore new machine learning algorithm that we never considered.\n",

    "TPOT use genetic programming to find the best tuned parameters and model ensembles. It randomly tries a pipeline, evaluate the performance, and randomly change parts of the pipeline for getting better performing algorithm. It will exclusively search in every steps for data preprocessing, feature selection and parameters tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation** <br>\n",
    "TPOT assume all features are numerical and with no missing values. Therefore, when a feature matrix or dataframe is feeded to TPOT, it will automatically impute missing values by **median value imputation**. If you want to have a different imputing method, you can impute before feeding into TPOT. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Features** <br>\n",
    "Another fascinating part of TPOT is it treats **features with fewer than 10 unique values as categorical** and TPOT programmed with **one-hot encoding**, which will encode those values automatically when running the algorithm. One-hot encoding is an algorithm that transfer categorical variable to a bunch of dummy variables, which only using 0s and 1s to represent each values. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "| index | pet |       \n",
    "| --- | --- |    \n",
    "| 0 | dog |      \n",
    "| 1 | cat |\n",
    "| 2 | bird|\n",
    "\n",
    "After one-hot encoding will be as: \n",
    "\n",
    "| index | dog | cat | bird |     \n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |   \n",
    "| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 2 | 0| 0 | 1|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling**<br>\n",
    "TPOT is also encoded with scaling, which can automatically scale in the default configuration and uses genetic programming to check if the data needs transformation in pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPOT will produce a score and improves while having more time. Sometimes it take hours or days to run it, which is saying, TPOT can perform better if running with longer time. Larger dataset would need more time. TPOT will evaluate 10,000 pipleline configurations for one generation before finishing, with TPOT default setting (100 generations and 100 population size). In total, TPOT will evaluate **population_size + generations x offspring_size** pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the default evaluation time by changing the parameters, but the trade-off is the performance of TPOT will also decrease since it does not comprehensively try all the possible algorithms in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, TPOT may result in different pipelines in different runs if the optimization algorithm does not converge due to lack of time. If the CV scores are same in two different pipline it implies the two pipelines have similar performance on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, TPOT generates customization operations and parameters in [doc](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/using/#customizing-tpots-operators-and-parameters). However, we will not focus on this part since the goal is to give an tutorial of how to implement TPOT practically.\n"

The accuracy achieved on the testing set by using the best pipeline is 96.28%. Moreover, all the pipeline generations are saved in telecom_checkpoint folder (we set periodic_checkpoint_folder parameters in the setting), which will be generated in the same directory when running the script, therefore it is easy to obtain every pipeline since first generation.

    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "1. Reduce bias and errors for machine learning models comparing to models building by human\n",
    "2. Save time and efforts for data scientists to build and test optimized models\n",
    "3. Perform with high accuracy\n",
    "4. Companies can reduce cost of hiring prefessionals since implementing autoML tools is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "1. AutoML takes time to run the model and depends on computation power\n",
    "2. AutoML is a fairly new concept, therefore it is important to apply this method in caution since it is still under development\n",
    "3. Less flexible if we want to have customize pipeline\n"

    "Automated Machine Learning tool is a very convenient technology that reduce our time to develop and test a model. It is also easy to implement, which create additional time to data scientists to concentrate in model interpretation. However, it is relatively less flexible if we want to have a customize pipline and time consuming. TPOT is one of the popular autoML packages which is easy to implement and is very helpful to identify the optimal parameters, models and ensembles."
